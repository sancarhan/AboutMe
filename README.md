# üí´ About Me:
I am Oƒüuzhan, I am 24 years old and I have not just started my software career. I started in the field of web design in my high school years. Even though I continued as an amateur after high school, I had 2 years of architectural education, so I received full stack developer training with Neos Software Academy. This training included HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. , JQUERY, REACT, PYTHON, DJANGO. After my education, I took part in a full stack project at Neos Yazƒ±lƒ±m Academy. If I talk about myself, I am a person who can work resolutely even under pressure, has endless patience, can take the lead in teamwork and has high persuasion skills, and I also have a humorous and entertaining nature.
