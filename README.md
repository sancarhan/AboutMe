# üí´ About Me:
Hello! I'm Oƒüuzhan Sancar, a creative and passionate software developer. My journey in web design and coding began during my high school years, and it gained an international dimension through my Erasmus+ internship in Germany. After completing my 2-year associate's degree in architectural restoration, I furthered my education at Neos Software Academy. I honed my skills across a wide range of technologies, starting from fundamental ones like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to more advanced tools like Bootstrap 5, Node.js, React, Python, Django, and C#.

Combining my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development, along with the training I received during my internship at the institution and my certification as a Specialist Software Developer from Fatih Sultan Mehmet Foundation University, has propelled me to the top of my field. My successes in the projects I've participated in have been recognized with Participation and ICCW certificates from Neos Software Academy. With a deep knowledge of computer science, I also provide expertise in hardware and programming topics.

Currently, I'm pushing boundaries and advancing further with projects in various fields, determined to shape the technologies of the future.
